More comprehensive documentation is accessible [here](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/).

Playground allows end-user to spin up a substrate based development environment in seconds. A full machine with terminal is then available from a web browser, ready to launch a chain and remotely access it.

## Trying it out

Access playground at [docs.substrate.io/playground/](https://docs.substrate.io/playground/).

## Support

Documentation can be found at [paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/) (and its source [here](website/docs/))

### Integrate

Playground can be [integrated](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/extending/integration) in external pages. This opens the door for more advanced usage e.g. interactive tutorials.
