# Substrate playground

A hosted website that enables the user to navigate [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) runtimes, modify them and run remotely accessible chain. In a couple seconds!

More comprehensive documentation is accessible [here](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/).

Playground allows end-user to spin up a substrate based development environment in seconds. A full machine with terminal is then available from a web browser, ready to launch a chain and remotely access it.
Playground templates can be [created and maintained](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/extending/custom-template) by 3rd parties. Playground instances can be [integrated and manipulated](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/extending/integration) via a JavaScript API.

## Trying it out

### Web

Access playground at [docs.substrate.io/playground/](https://docs.substrate.io/playground/).

### CLI

Playground templates can be started on a local machine (`docker` must be available).

```shell
npm install -g @substrate/playground-cli
substrate-playground
# or
npx @substrate/playground-cli
```

Then browse a locally accessible web IDE at http://localhost.

## Support

Documentation can be found at [paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/) (and its source [here](website/docs/))

### Integrate

Playground can be [integrated](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/extending/integration) in external pages. This opens the door for more advanced usage e.g. interactive tutorials.

### Contribute a template

Extra `template` (custom docker images) can be [created](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/extending/custom-template) and made available on playground.

## Roadmap

Track progress [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-playground/projects)

## Deployment

Playground is a set of containerized apps deployed on a kubernetes cluster. Fear not, it's quite simple to [deploy](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-playground/docs/operating/deployment) it!
